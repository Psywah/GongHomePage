# Biography
I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2013 and PhD degree in computational mathematics from Peking University in 2018. Before joining the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), I worked as a postdoctoral scholar at Pennsylvania State University (2018-2019), and then as a research associate at the University of Bath (2019-2021). My research interests include scientific computing and numerical analysis, mainly focusing on finite element, domain decomposition methods, and preconditioning techniques.

# Biography
My research interests include scientific computing, mixed finite element methods, domain decomposition methods, multigrid methods and the nonlinearly preconditioned Newton methods. Now I am working with <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/masigg/"> Ivan Graham</a> and <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/eas25/">Euan Spence</a> on fast solvers for frequency-domain wave-scattering problems.

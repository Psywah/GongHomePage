abstract = "The  Restricted Additive  Schwarz method  with impedance  transmission conditions, also known as the  Optimised Restricted Additive Schwarz (ORAS)  method,  is a simple overlapping  one-level parallel domain decomposition method, which has been successfully used as an iterative solver and as a preconditioner for   discretized Helmholtz boundary-value problems. In this paper, we give, for the first time, a convergence analysis for ORAS as an iterative solver -- and also as a preconditioner -- for nodal finite element Helmholtz systems of any polynomial order. The analysis starts by showing  (for general domain decompositions)  that ORAS is  an unconventional finite element approximation of a classical parallel iterative Schwarz method, formulated at the PDE (non-discrete) level. This non-discrete Schwarz method was recently analysed in [Gong, Gander, Graham, Lafontaine, Spence, arXiv 2106.05218], and the present paper gives a corresponding discrete version of this analysis. In particular, for  domain decompositions in strips in 2-d, we show that, when the mesh size is small enough, ORAS inherits the convergence properties of the Schwarz method, independent of polynomial order. The proof relies on characterising the ORAS iteration in terms of discrete `impedance-to-impedance maps', which we prove (via a novel weighted finite-element error analysis)  converge as $h\\rightarrow 0$ in the operator norm to their non-discrete counterparts."
